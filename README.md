# University Challenge

University Challenge is a web based quiz show application modelled on the
popular UK television show. It manages the competing teams and takes care of
buzzing and scoring, but does *not* handle the questions themselves.

It works best with a separate quiz master asking questions and game master
controlling the game and with two sets of four physical buzzers.

## Setup

* You need two sets of four buzzers e.g. the PS2 or PS3 Buzz! Quiz buzzers are
  knwon to work well
* Connect the buzzers to the game master's laptop via USB
* Map the buzzers for team 1 to the keys 1 to 4 and for team 2 to 5 to 8
* If your buzzers are recognized as a USB joystick, you can use keymapping
  tools like [QJoyPad](http://qjoypad.sourceforge.net) on Linux or
  [Xpadder](http://xpadder.com) on Windows
